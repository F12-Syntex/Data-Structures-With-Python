# Data Structures Practice

This repository is created for practicing data structures using Python. The main focus currently is on trees.

## Roadmap

1. Implement Binary Tree
2. Implement Binary Search Tree
3. Implement AVL Tree
4. Implement Red-Black Tree
5. Implement Trie
6. Implement Heap
7. Implement Graph

Feel free to modify the roadmap and add any additional data structures you want to practice.
